It's been hot riding in Greece, even though it's still only late Spring and we've been grateful for the plentiful water fountains that dot the hillside providing opportunities for a quick duck of the head under cooling spring waters. There's also been a good number of minimarts meaning we don't have to carry so much food and there's usually an opportunity for an ice cream/chocolate milk stop in the afternoons.

Leaving Smokovo Dam our route continued up and then along the valley side, undulating up and down with views across vast flat farmlands of wheat and olives and across to the bays of the Aegean Sea. Taking the secondary road to avoid State Highway 3 we climbed up to Eleftherochori village passing a WW1 memorial dedicated to the Australian troops who had fought in this area. Just before the village a car passed us whilst we were stopped for a break, and a large bearded man with a big smile got out and came to shake our hands. He spoke no English and we spoke no Greek but managed to gather from alot of pointing and shooting actions that this area was a big part of the partisan movement in WW1 and lots of Antipodean soldiers joined the Greek resistance here. We waved our goodbyes (several times) before hitting the road again which was cut deep into the valley sides and made for spectacular riding. Five minutes down the road our new friend's car appeared again. He insisted we stop for a break. Having booked our ferry tickets to Crete the day before we were under a bit of time pressure and reluctant to stop again, but going with the flow we stopped by the village fountain where our friend proceeded to get out from his car some plastic cups with what looked like a large black olive floating in a black sambuca-like liquid, a small fork and some napkins. Jules took a tentative bite, whilst our friend flexed his biceps and presumably said something like 'to make you strong'! The flavour was defintely aniseed and sweet and the texture like a chewy dried fruit. More sign language and he showed us the tree where the 'fruit' grew. We later found out it was walnuts, never would have guessed, but of course from that momenton we saw walnut trees everywhere!

We stopped in Gravia to buy lunch in a minimart before heading up a 700m climb to Eptalofos. As we were packing the food away the lady in the minimart ran out with a small package for us 'Greek feta cheese, the best!' she said. We gratefully accepted and it made a splendid addition to our sandwiches! Eptalofos is on the north western slopes of Mount Parnassos and is a ghost town in the off season. Over the top and into the Kalubia Libadiou valley ski chalets filled the valley floor, and at least one cafe and the oetrol station were open! The place to stop and spend time (if you have it) is just down the road in Arachova, a charming town built into the mountain side with beautiful views down the valley towards Delphi and across to old Byzantine churces. There's also an incredible bakery on the main road out of town which sells melt in your mouth 'bougatsa' - a greek pastry filled with semolina custard and sprinkled with icing sugar and cinnamon.
