Pictures to come!

Do you ever make plans that don't quite work out? We've learnt to embrace our more spontaneous side over the past few weeks and in Switzerland that has certainly paid off. After a trip across the bridge to do our shopping in Germany, our original plan to take a rest day in Basel was scuppered by 'Basel World', Switzerland's largest gathering of watch makers! With prices hiked in the city (even the YHA was going to cost us £70 each for a dorm room) we headed to Kaiseraugst, led down the back streets by a local on a very fine Pinnion bike, to a campsite on the Rhine that had just opened that day! It was an idyllic spot and we made the most of it the next morning doing bike maintenance, washing etc, before heading over the 'hill' to Aarau - a short 45km but with nearly 1000km of ascent we sure knew we'd made it to Switzerland!

We were hosted again by so many lovely Warmshowers hosts in Switzerland, several whom also had an eye for maps and even worked in GIS like Jules. We were treated to raclette and homemade and foraged Swiss delicacies we will never forget - wild garlic pesto, apricot tarts and Russian bread to name a few. With so much to talk about we often had late nights but mornings were a bit more relaxed! Luckily for us we had extra motivation during the day in the form of Maud, Jules's old work colleague who now lives in Zurich. Maud is a fountain of knowledge and not only guided us through all the best sweet treats in the bakeries, with the Engadiner Nusstorte (caremelised nut tart) being a joint favourite, but also the menus, the crazy Swiss-German language (plus Swiss-Italian, Swiss-French & Romansch), and the many Swiss intracacies. It was lots of fun cycling as a three and she'll be sorely missed.

Our time in Switzerland was defintely dominated by three things: hills, kind people and cheese! The Swiss have cheese for breakfast, lunch and dinner, so naturally we followed suit! As soon as we crossed the border we had cars stopping to ask if we needed directions, had four fantastic Warmshowers hosts and even an offer to stay in a beautiful hotel free of charge for the night. 

As for the hills, any excuse for a climb and Jules will take it! Maud is also queen of the mountain, although perhaps drew the line at pushing the bikes uphill through a muddy farm for 500m, but yes it was worth it for the views! Absolutely stunning landscapes with the snow making a beautiful contrast with the mountains and the sky. The two climbs that were on the list in particular were the Julier pass (2284m) and the Offenpass (2147m), both open throughout winter snow dependent...
