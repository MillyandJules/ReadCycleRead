In May 2016 we persuaded 3 cycle mad & just plain mad friends to do the infamous London-Paris route in just 2 days! 

Here we are setting off from Tower Bridge, unsurprisingly in the typical London drizzle!

Though if we thought this was bad we were in for a deluge the following day with unprecedented levels of rain falling in the Paris region causing floods and all sorts of chaos!
