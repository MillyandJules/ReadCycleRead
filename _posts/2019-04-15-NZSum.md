**We saw**

Breathtaking scenery: mountains, rivers, lakes, forest, scrubland, glaciers, coastal clifss. You name it and New Zelanad has probably got it. The downside to taking the West Coast of the South Island is that it's infamous for rain, but then you wouldn't get the lush green rainforest so you can't have it all!

**We ate**  

Our vegetarian diet took a bit of a backseat as we stayed with many friends and family all of farming backgrounds bought up on meat and two veg! Not complaining though, we've been fed so well by everyone we've stayed with here and very grateful. Tip Top ice cream is back on the menu for Jules, and chocolate milk, a solid post-ride favourite! We've had our fair share of fish and chips, mussels, pipis and other sea food. Oh and bread sweet bread! It's been a luxury to be able to stop and make our own sandwiches again.
