Enter Croatia! The border town of Babno Polje is nothing much but did provide us with water outside the cemetery. Cemeteries have proven good water resources as there is often a tap linked to the mains for people to water flowers around the graves. Less common in really hot countries but otherwise a pretty reliable source of water.  

Our journey in Croatia started and ended with a good hill! Our route took us through the well stocked town on Gerovo where there was one of those signposts telling you how far you are from other countries - apparently 1201 kms to London and 18,128 kms to NZ. I presume this is as the crow flies as we've already done over 2300 kms from south of London!

On recommendation from our Warmshowers host in Slovenia we stopped at the 'Vagabundina Koliba' hut for a warming meal of wild mushroom soup, homemade sausages, roasted vegetables, thyme barley, polenta and stinging nettle balls - have to be tried. With full stomachs it was lucky that the next 10 kms were all down hill, fast through magical old forests and then out onto the rocky cliffs above the ocean where the landscape completely changed to dry scrubland.
