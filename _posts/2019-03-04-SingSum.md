**We saw**  

Singapore is a very green city. The Gardens by the Bay being the most recent addition and well worth a walk around. The Botanical Gardens are a beautiful oasis of calm in the city and we even spotted a few hornbills there.  

**We ate**  

A medley of cuisines. Singaporeans come from many different backgrounds including China, Malaysia and India. We made sure to sample as much as we could before hitting New Zealand. We had fantastic curries, satay, pad thai salads, prawns, washed down with excellent coffee and cake. It was also heaven to be able to drink a cool glass of wine in the hot humid evenings!
