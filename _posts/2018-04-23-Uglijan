From Zadar we took the ferry across to Preko on the island of Uglijan, another short scenic trip. We used Jadrolina ferries which are the main ferry carrier and charge about 1 euro per kilometre for each passenger (double for bikes), and were very efficient. Very quiet coastal roads led up to a mountain bike track which we thought we'd try and head up for a decent camp. You would have thought we'd learnt by now that the gravel roadsof Croatia are no plain sailing. We did get treated to spectacular views at the top though. The evening was slightly marred by 'the burnt bum incident'!!! Cooking on rocky ground I was unlucky enough to be sitting just below the cooker when it came to the boil and jolted off the stand to fall next to me. Bolting up, pants down I yelled 'need cold water'! Of course we were on top of a hill in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water for supper and breakfast so had to make do with making a dripping water bottle last 10 minutes, luckily a cooling breeze helped. It would have been quite a site had anyone happened to walk past! First aid kit out and gauze strip on by the morning it looked a little less pink but was quite literally a 'pain in the arse' for the next week.

Making our way south a small interconnecting bridge takes you to Pasman island where we took awesome local roads and jumped on the ferry at Tkon back to the mainland. The Croatian countryside was now at its best, winding through olive groves, vineyards and small villages, the landscape is more what I would expect of Italy. We hit the water again at Zaton, a beautiful village at the end of an estuary. It's a busy road from Zaton to Sisnek, unfortunately unavoidable but soon escaped back inland. We'd learnt to be wary of gravel roads in Croatia but had our first OSMAnd map fail where a sealed road turned into a grassy field track and then stopped at a railway track. Jules was ready to haul the bikes over when I spotted a small tunnel to the right which led under the track - literally a hobbit hole - which then pops you out in another field to join the main road - phew!
