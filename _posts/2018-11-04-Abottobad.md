We knew we'd have a few days respite before hitting the police escorts and the worsening road conditions and we weren't disappointed. The road condition remains excellent until you hit Raikot Bridge, the main turn-off for those visiting Nanga Parabat base camp or the luscious sounding Fairy Meadows. Sadly we had no time to visit these mountain retreats, but after seeing photos it's on the list of places to come back and see. We had to make do with views of Mt Nanga Parabat from afar. At 8192m high it is the 9th highest mountain in the world and 2nd highest in Pakistan after K2. It's incredibly impressive even from afar, and quite awe-inspiring how close the Karakorum Highway goes to these majestic peaks. Adding to the geographical highlights you pass the point where three of the world's highest mountain ranges meet - the Karakorums, the Himalaya and the Hindu Kush, in addition to passing the confluence of the Gilgit and mighty Indus rivers (the Indus is the 3rd longest river in Asia, 21st longest in the world).
