**We slept**  
In a strange health club lounge...see blog!  

**We ate**  
Not much, although managed to find some dumplings for breakfast.  

**We saw**  
A lot of police signs, barbed wire fences and Chinese tourists. A mix of Han Chinese and Uighur Muslims. Yaks, cold and snow. Steaming hot dumplings cooked over the fire were the highlight.
