No. days: 11 days  
Distance: 640 kms (398 miles)

**We slept**  

Tent: 7 nights wildcamping + 1 night in a hotel garden

**We saw**  

Enough sand to fill a beach, twisting jungles, scavenging monkeys and honking trucks and death-defying bus drivers. Hundreds of people, onlookers of all sorts especially travelling along the border with India. We'll have to go back to see the mountains!  

**We ate**  

Vegetable momos (steamed dumplings), chow mein, samosas, veg thalis (rice and curry), chatpate (puffed rice snack mixed up with spices and lime pickle) and drunk litres of warm mango juice to quench our thirst on the dusty roads.
