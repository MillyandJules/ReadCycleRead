**We cycled**  
From: Sukobin to Kalovrisi (via Macedonia)  
No. days: 6 + 1 rest day  
Distance: 440 kms (273 miles)   

TOTAL from UK: 3,828 kms (2378 miles)  

**We slept**  
Tent: 6 nights (2 recovering from a stomach bug at Camping Suc)  
Hostel/BnB: 1  

**We ate**  
Lots of olives, sheeps cheese, plaqui (big beans) and salc kosi a kind of hung sheeps yoghurt.  

**We saw**  
Petrol stations aplenty! Lavahs (car wash) nearly outnumbered petrol stations, also plenty of roadworks, potholes (maybe when the new roads are finished the potholes will be gone!?) and meandering tortoises to close to the roads.
