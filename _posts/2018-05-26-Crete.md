Our ferry arrived in Chania, Crete about 6:30am but there wasno huge rush to get off as unloading all the cars and trucks takes a while. So by 7:30 we were on our way in search of a beach for breakfast. By 8:30 it was hot! It was going to be a big day making our way over the mountains to the south coast. 

We cycled east as far as Vamos and then turned south inland. Instantly we got a friendly, relaxed vibe from Crete, this is the island-side of Greece we had heard so much about. An olive oil factory on the side of the road proved irresistible and we managed to get a small bottle to take with us. The owner had told us about a kiwi lady who runs a cafe in Georgioupoli but sadly it was a 6km downhill detour so we sadly missed out, next time! We went through small villages as far as Kryonerida before joining the main road up and over to Imbros Gorge, a mecca for hikers. On the way up we passed a sports field where some local kids had worked out how to turn the taps on to water the astro turf and were having water fights, we joined in and soaked ourselves, which just about kept us cool to the top of the climb.  

It's a spectacular descent down from Imbros down to the coast where we stopped for a Sfakian pie. The Greeks tend to call all pastries 'pies' so to Jules' initial disappointment, and Milly's delight, a Sfakian pie is not a meat and olive filled pie but a cheese filled pancake served with honey, a great second breakfast. After 17 days of continuous riding and 14,075 metres of climbing my legs were ready to give in by this point. With the heat and winding steep undulations along the coast road thrown in it took us nearly all day to get to Plakias where we took a much needed break.

The day we left Plakias we awoke to howling winds, the type that sends chills down your spine when you know you have a day of cycling ahead. It started as a tailwind, although rather than being helpful it was quite a hindrance requiring intense concentration to look out for sideways gusts that can blow you into or off the road! A 10km gravel track shortcut avoided the gorge that would have definitely been a headwind, but was course gravel and still windy so required a lot of pushing. Through fields of olives the road then goes steeply up and then down to Agia Gallini, a touristy spot butperfect for ice cream on the beach. Up again, down again (there is no flat on Crete) we passed through hundreds of greenhouses in Tympaki and met a Dutch guy who'd cycled to Greece and never left!
