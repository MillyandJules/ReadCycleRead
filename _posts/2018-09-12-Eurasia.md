We are eternally grateful to the people we met along the way who fed us and quenched our thirst on many occasions. Particular thanks goes to the kindness of those on [**Warmshowers**](https://www.warmshowers.org) and the few locals we met who invited us into their home for the evening, often at short notice, and never expected anything in retun.  We will continue to 'pay it forward' with generosity and kindness to others.

**Items lost :(**  
Clickstand - Milly now has to find a tree, wall, or other suitably sturdy object to lean her bike against every time we stop. Replacement will be ordered!!!  
Titanium spork  
Pair of pants!  

**Broken:**  
Powermonkey cable  
X cup & bowls (silicone splits - they're 8 years old so not so bad)  
Hole in thermorest, on day 8! Patched up nicely.  
Screw on Jules Shimano sandal cleat  
Jules' rear mudguard rivets sheared off from rocks on road -fixed with cable ties.  
Jules' rear mudguard flap came loose - fixed with cable ties.  
Jules' bottom bracket came loose - once in Switzerland and again in Albania.  
Jules' seat post bolt broke and got stuck in the threads....nightmare!! Helped by a lovely Turkish local.  
The waterproof coating on our Ortlieb rack packs have worn away at the bottom where the bag rubs on our rear pannier clips. Patched up with Gorilla tape, however we're sure this is a design flaw of Ortlieb.  

**No. punctures:**  
Milly: 0  
Jules: 1  

Not bad!
