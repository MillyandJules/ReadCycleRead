Our journey in Slovenia started with a good descent down from the Wurzenpass to Kransjska Gora, a popular ski resort but with only patches of snow left now. Higher up the mountains though there was still plenty of snow which meant that the famous Vrsic Pass with 48 hairpins had closed again and we had to plan a different route south.

Up until now our route had more or less followed the plan Jules had meticulously mapped out before we left the UK. Now we are in unknown territory but our digital mapping app OsmAnd still has a remarkable amount of information on cycling tracks so we managed to work our way to Lake Bled almost entirely off road, passing over the clearest blue streams and the greenest fields, dotted with small holdings. It looks like the farming techniques here havent changed for hundreds of years and it was refreshing to see small crop rotations and families out working in the fields together, although we saw some fairly precarious pruning techniques, often with the oldest looking man up on the highest branch with a very rickety ladder for stability.
