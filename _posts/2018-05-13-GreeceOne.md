It was a nice quiet border crossing from Albania to Greece at Karlovrisi. The border control guys were also very friendly and taught us a few words in Greek - the basics, which we promptly forgot and had to look up again 5 minutes later! After a lunch stop by an ornate drinking fountain, one of many we would pass on the roadside in Greece, we headed for the hills where we had a decision to make. With an impending storm looming overhead, do we go left via Kalovrisi, a flatter route to start but longer overall, or right stright up into the Pindus National Park. We went right and whilst we got a good soaking we also got an amazing view of the storm over the valley. We camped near Kalpaki and stocked up in the minimart there as well as giving the lady at the bakery a big surprise with how much ordered
