**We ate**  

So much roti (tandoori cooked flat breads), chana dhal (chickpea curry), vegetable curry, lentil dhal, dried aprices, apples, samosas, pakoras, mixed pickles and a lot of  Pakastani chai - sweet lightly spiced and always very milky tea.

**We saw**  

Incredible 7000m peaks, autumn leaves, ibex, rushing mountain rivers, snow, sun, colour and smiles. We bumped into 5 other cycle tourists and cycled with four of them at seperate times. We've made new friend's and can't wait to return to Pakistan one day.
