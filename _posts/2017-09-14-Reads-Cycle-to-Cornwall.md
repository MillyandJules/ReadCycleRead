Chichester - Falmouth stats:

No. days: 8
Distance: 483 km
Assent: 6,500 m
No. Punctures: 1
Highs (J):
Highs (C): Discovering I can haul 38kg uphill after 6 week off cycling & finding a campsite with a heated pool & sauna! 
Lows (J): 
Lows (C): Dartmoor hills + puncture


What better way to put the bikes through a range of weather, ground, ups and downs, twists and turns than by following the UK's [National Cycle Route 2](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/route-2) from Chichester to Cornwall. They certainly got a test, it rained
