**We cycled**  
From: Bllatë e Sipërme to Sveti Naum  
No. days: 2  
Distance: 95 kms (59 miles)  
Ascent: 650 m  

See [**Strava**](https://www.strava.com/athletes/readcycleread) - @readcycleread - for full route details.  


**We slept**  
Tent: 2 nights (1 night in Scouts campground)  

**We ate**  
Quite a bit considering we were recovering from a stomach bug! Spent an afternoon at the very relaxed Cuba Libre Beach House on Lake Ohrid - lots of sesame snacks and olives.  

**We saw**  
Wind, lakes, forest and sadly lots of roadside rubbish.
